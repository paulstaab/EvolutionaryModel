\usage{
sumstat_ihh(name = "ihh", position = NA, population = 1, group = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{position}{A position relative to the locus extent, e.g. 0.5 for the
middle of the locus. If provided, the iHH will be calculate using the SNP
closest to the given position as focal SNP. Otherwise, all SNPs will be
used as focal SNPs in turn, and all the values reportet. If trios are used,
than the position is relative to the middle locus' extend.}

\item{group}{The locus group for which this summary statistic is reported.
The default of `0` corresponds to all groups.}
